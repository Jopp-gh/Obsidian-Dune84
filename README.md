### Intro
My theme is called after [**Frank Herbert**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Herbert)'s eponymous novel cycle. His novels were incredibly successful and influenced **Science-fiction** and everything related afterwards, so nobody dared to portray his universe on big screen until [**Dune** from 1984](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087182/), directed by [**David Lynch**](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000186/bio). I still enjoy to watch Dune from 1984, - both Frank and David created an epic, evergreen artwork. 

> Dune's color palette:
> - **daylight palette** with warm colors: _wood - sand - rosé_,
> - **nighttime palette** with fresh colors: _dusk - midnight - blacky_,  
> - **flat tones** resembling Obsidian's default b/w theme. You can customize both "flat tones" with the colors you like! 

> [!tip]
> 
> If you read further, you will discover this theme is not just a color play, but **Dune adds a ton of new features** as well! Check out its [features](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/tree/main#features)

### 📋 First steps

> [!important]
> 1. **to display "Dune" correctly** and to change all preferences added by my theme, install the community plugin [**Style Settings**](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) by mgMeyers
> 2. Dune offers a **clean, clutter-free experience**. Open `Settings>Style Settings>Dune>Show` if you want re-enable buttons / tabs and restore default looks of Obsidian. 
> 3. download Dune's **Mermaid theme** and **tweaks for supported community plugins** from [here](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/tree/main/snippets). See the list of tweaked plugins for Dune [here](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84#tweaked)
> 4. I highly reccomend to download Dune's [cssclass cheatsheet](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/Wiki/cheatsheet%20cssclasses%20Dune.md) and Dune's [callout-fences-tags cheatsheet](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/Wiki/cheatsheet-Callouts%2C%20Fences%2C%20Tags.md).
