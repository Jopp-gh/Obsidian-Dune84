# Dune-1984


As a big fan of [**Frank Herbert**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Herbert)'s famous Dune novels and its gorgeous cinematic transposition of [**Dune**](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087182/?ref_=nm_ov_bio_lk)(1984) written and directed by [**David Lynch**](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000186/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm), i developed this theme to create a pleasant environment for my PKM activities in Obsidian.

This theme offers many features to organize your documents with reworked notes, callouts, custom tables.
Stilistic elements for poetry and various decorations add a particular touch to your documents, pictures are customizable in a variety of ways.

Printing (**Export as PDF**) keeps your overall color scheme, except for dark themed backgrounds, which will be replaced with white backgrounds.
**Slide** is a core plugin of Obsidian to create slideshows on-the-fly. Now Slides' interface is bigger, less cluttered and includes as well all features added by this theme
  
Particular attention `:has` got the **phone interface**, its overall look is more compact and most features implemented for the desktop version work technically speaking, on the phone version, too.
Your notes will have more breath, bigger buttons are easier to spot and therefore, keep your interaction in flow.

My main goal for **Dune** was to get a clean, clutter-free experience and so most buttons are semi-hidden by default (desktop). With **Style Settings** installed, you can re-enable buttons and tabs if you prefer Obsidians default interface.

To start using my theme, open **Style Settings>Dune>Colors>Theme** and choose a color scheme (`Dune 1` or `Dune 2`) for your light theme and a color scheme for your dark theme (`Dune 3` or `Dune 4`). Enjoy!
