### Dune
My theme is called after [**Frank Herbert**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Herbert)'s eponymous novel cycle. 
His novels were incredibly successful and influenced **Science-fiction** and everything related afterwards, so nobody dared to portray his universe on big screen until [**Dune** from 1984](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087182/?ref_=nm_ov_bio_lk), directed by [**David Lynch**](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000186/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm).

**Dune from 1984** was a relatively tight-budget movie but nevertheless, a very artistic, spectacular and cinematic transposition of Frank's novels, very well narrated and worth to see as a whole. I continue to watch **David Lynch**'s Dune from time to time and this movie is still able to catch my interest, even after so long time. 
Recenty, we saw more movies/tv series related to Dune, where I appreciated *background scenery* and *costume design*. 
**Dune: Part Two** by Denis Villeneuve is a pretty decent movie too and I hope his sequel will be even better.

<br>

### Goal
My goal with this theme was to improve Obsidian by **removing some distractions / annoyances, adding missing features and improving, expanding on available features**. Last but not least, I needed a change of colors, **less extreme black - white values** and **everything printer friendly**, no matter what theme (light / dark) I decided to use. 

Both core functions - printing and presentation **Export as PDF / Slide** got some cleanup and were adapted to work on smaller interfaces too (phone). Also, I tried my best to make Dune accessible to tablets users too - since I don't have a tablet myself any support for these devices relies on **your feedback**. 

_I am very pleased with the features added_ to **Dune** and hope this overhaul will **benefit your workflow** _to compose nice and useful page layouts_, **reduce friction** _with the features installed_ and **improve your overall note-making** in Obsidian _with the regular use of Dune_.

<br>

### Motivation
Also, would you be so nice to support me with a breakfast or lunch ? :) 
*It's not just about the good deed, but to connect with other people*, _like you connect useful and interesting data in Obsidian and have new, inspiring and awesome insights!_

Please show me your gratitude for the work I have done and smash that [**Buy me a coffee**](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/README.md#contribute)-button at bottom page, this would mean a lot to me! **Thanks for your attention !**

First I've build Dune for myself; only later I added many nice features for a larger audience. At times it wasn't an easy task to code but a true endurance test ! 

**I released this theme in the hope to make new friends too**. If you need support or you wanna share ideas and interests related to pkm, creative activities, programming or architecture, feel free to contact me. 
_Private massage me_  `Jopp` on [Forum.obsidian.md](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/theme-dune/60433) and let's talk about some of following topics (sorted in no particular order):

### Updates

To make sure you're always up-to-date, open Obsidians `Preferences>Appearance>` then click on `Check for updates` 
> → If you can't run the newest version of Obsidian, then try to install older [releases](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/releases) 
of Dune. Note, you should prefer to install Dune directly from your Obsidian app as the files under **releases** are older versions and only made available for backward compatibiliy purposes.

<br>


## First steps

1. **to display "Dune-1984" correctly** and to get all options added by my theme, get [**Style Settings**](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) by mgMeyers
2. Dune offers a **clean, clutter-free experience**, so most buttons are semi-hidden by default (desktop). Open `Preferences>Style Settings>Dune>Show ui elements` if you want re-enable buttons / tabs and restore default looks of Obsidians. Also take a look at Dune's quick [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/Wiki/Troubleshooting.md#troubleshooting) 
3. download [this companion snippet](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/snippets/folder-icons-v2.css) to **add icons to your folder tree**
5. get a complete overview of Dune's [cssclass cheatsheet](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/Wiki/cheatsheet%20cssclasses%20Dune.md) and Dune's [callout-fences-tags cheatsheet](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/Wiki/cheatsheet-Callouts%2C%20Fences%2C%20Tags.md)

**Plugin authors, theme designers and developers** _want to add value to this interconnected world and share with you their passions_. We put a lot of love in the design process of our products and try hard to implement ideas and feedbacks as working code parameters. The bigger code projects grow, the harder this code maintenace becomes, because of the sheer amount of commands which need to work together as a whole. 

With every new update **quality standards raise**, this status quickly becomes a "new normality" and autors only know how much happened behind the scenes to deliver this high quality standards. 
This "Normality" or "Standard" is nothing cheap and needs more attention. Let's make this world a better place and start to support consciously benefactors to become in turn, benefactors ourselves. Every - little - contribute **is valuable**.

> To make a simple comparison: in a household you need to spend a lot of time to do your usual chores, unfortunately after you're done nobody seems to notice and all your effort gets tagged as a matter of fact, a responsibility of somebody else, for which "the others" don't need to care. A bit sad.
