# Dune-1984


**Dune** has been developed with care over an extended period of time. Version 1 was designed for desktop only, version 2 added phone support. Just the 3rd Version of Dune was designed for the public, this version got many new additions, code rewrites, tweakings, bug fixes.
I called this theme **Dune**, after the novel sequels of one of my favorite sci-fi writers [**Frank Herbert**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Herbert). His novel **Dune** also appeared in a gorgeous cinematic transpositions on big screen, to be exact in [**Dune**](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087182/?ref_=nm_ov_bio_lk)(1984) written and directed by [**David Lynch**](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000186/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm).

My **goal** was to improve Obsidian by removing some distractions / annoyances, adding missing features, improving and expanding on available features. Last but not least, I needed a change of colors, less extreme black and white values and everything printer friendly, no matter what theme (light / dark) I decided to use. Both core functions - printing and presentation (Export as PDF / Slide) got a refreshed look, and were adapted to work on smaller interfaces too (phone).

I am very pleased with form and function of **Dune** and hope this overhaul will benefit your overall workflow, reduce friction, improve your note-making with Obsidian. Also, I hope, to pay my breakfast/lunch for sharing good content with you. Please see the **Buy me a coffee** button at bottom page.

### First steps

1. to display "Dune-1984" correctly and to get all options added by my theme, get [**Style Settings**](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) by mgMeyers
2. To activate my theme, open `Preferences>Style Settings>Dune>Colors>Theme` to choose a color scheme for your light theme  (Dune 1 or Dune 2) and a color scheme for your dark theme (Dune 3 or Dune 4)
3. Dune offers a clean, clutter-free experience, so most buttons are semi-hidden by default (desktop). open `Preferences>Style Settings>Dune>Show ui elements` if you want re-enable buttons / tabs and restore default looks of Obsidians.
