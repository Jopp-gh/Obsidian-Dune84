### Name
I called my theme **Dune**, after a novel cycle from one of my favorite sci-fi writers, [**Frank Herbert**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Herbert).
His novels were incredibly successful and significantly influenced the **Sci-fi genre** afterwards, but nobody dared to portray his universe on big screen until [**Dune** from 1984](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087182/?ref_=nm_ov_bio_lk), directed by [**David Lynch**](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000186/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm).
**Dune from 1984** was a relatively tight-budget movie but nevertheless, a very artistic and spectacular cinematic transposition of Frank's Dune, very well narrated and worth to see as a whole - i continue to watch this movie from time to time and it seems to be an evergreen for me, which happens rarely to me.

Recenty, we could see more movies/tv series of Dune, where i appreciated *background scenery* and *costume design*, but 2 components alone don't make a movie, so unfortunately, i wont cite them as successors here. 

### Goal
My **goal** with this theme was to improve Obsidian by removing some distractions / annoyances, adding missing features, improving, expanding on available features. Last but not least, I needed a change of colors, less extreme black - white values and everything printer friendly, no matter what theme (light / dark) I decided to use. Both core functions - printing and presentation (Export as PDF / Slide) got a refreshed look and were adapted to work on smaller interfaces too (phone). I tried my best to adapt Dune for tablets, i did this in emulation - since i do not own a tablet any support for this device needs **your feedback**

### Motivation
I am very pleased with form and function of **Dune** and hope this overhaul will benefit your overall workflow, reduce friction, improve your note-making with Obsidian. 
<br>
Also, I hope to pay my breakfast/lunch for sharing good content with you. Please see the [**Buy me a coffee**](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/README.md#contribute) at bottom page.

### Attention
```
Obsidian v1.2.8 introduced several breaking changes, therefore, 
newer versions of Dune wont be fully backward compatible with versions older than v1.2.8+
```

## First steps

1. to display "Dune-1984" correctly and to get all options added by my theme, get [**Style Settings**](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) by mgMeyers
2. To activate my theme, open `Preferences>Style Settings>Dune>Colors>Theme` and choose a color scheme for your **light theme  (Dune 1 or Dune 2)** and a color scheme for your **dark theme (Dune 3 or Dune 4)**
3. Dune offers a clean, clutter-free experience, so most buttons are semi-hidden by default (desktop). open `Preferences>Style Settings>Dune>Show ui elements` if you want re-enable buttons / tabs and restore default looks of Obsidians.
4. to get a complete overview of Dune's `cssclasses`, get the [cssclass cheatsheet of Dune](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/Wiki/cheatsheet%20cssclasses%20Dune.md)

thanks for your interest in my theme. Right now i only accept bug reports and feature requests. 

First, to accept collaborators i would like to know you better. You are welcome to chat with me on Discord (Obsidians Member Group) or the official forums (https://forum.obsidian.md)
Second, to accept collaborators i look for people able to integrate features which i am unable to build myself. So far i did not need very much help and I enjoyed the development of Dune.
