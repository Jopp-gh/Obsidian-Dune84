### 🎨 Dune
My theme is called after [**Frank Herbert**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Herbert)'s eponymous novel cycle. 
His novels were incredibly successful and influenced **Science-fiction** and everything related afterwards, so nobody dared to portray his universe on big screen until [**Dune** from 1984](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087182/?ref_=nm_ov_bio_lk), directed by [**David Lynch**](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000186/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm). I still enjoy to watch Dune from 1984, - both Frank and David created an epic, evergreen artwork.

The daylight palette is a **warm** _wood - sand - rosé tint,_ meanwhile the nighttime palette is a **fresh**, _dusk - midnight - blacky tint_ one, plus two flat tones resembling the default Obsidian b/w theme. Additionally, you can change colors in Dune's preferences, so there should be enough variety for everbody's taste. If you read further, you will discover Dune is not just a color play, but adds a ton of new features too! Check out its [features](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/tree/main#features)

Please support this project! Check out [Dune Gold](https://buymeacoffee.com/jopp.gh/extras) too!

### 📋 First steps

1. **to display "Dune" correctly** and to get the preferences added by my theme, get [**Style Settings**](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) by mgMeyers
2. Dune offers a **clean, clutter-free experience**, so most buttons are semi-hidden by default (desktop). Open `Settings>Style Settings>Dune>Show` if you want re-enable buttons / tabs and restore default looks of Obsidian. 
3. download Dune's **Mermaid theme**, **Folder Icons** and tweaks for **supported community plugins** from [here](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/tree/main/snippets). See the list of plugins tweaked for Dune [here](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84#tweaked)
5. get a complete overview of Dune's [cssclass cheatsheet](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/Wiki/cheatsheet%20cssclasses%20Dune.md) and Dune's [callout-fences-tags cheatsheet](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/Wiki/cheatsheet-Callouts%2C%20Fences%2C%20Tags.md). Also take a look at Dune's quick [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/Wiki/Troubleshooting.md#troubleshooting)

## 📢 Contribute

Support me, if you like what you get  :)

 **Plugin authors, theme designers and developers** _want to add value to this interconnected world and share with you their passions_. The bigger code projects grow, the harder the code maintenace becomes. With every new update **quality standards raise** and this effort needs to get much more attention. Let's make this world a better place and start to support benefactors to become in turn, benefactors ourselves. Every - little - donation **is valuable**. 

Furthermore, I've spent more than a hundred of hours in the development, design and implementation of features in Dune - over the past 3 years. So…Would you be so nice to support me with a breakfast or lunch ? :) <br>
To support this project and honor the continuous work behind Dune, have a look at [Dune Gold](https://buymeacoffee.com/jopp.gh/extras). Dune-Silver(the free version) comes already with a lot of goodies, but it offers only half the features of Dune-Gold.
