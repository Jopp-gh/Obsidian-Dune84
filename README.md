### Dune
My theme is called after [**Frank Herbert**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Herbert)'s eponymous novel cycle. 
His novels were incredibly successful and influenced **Science-fiction** and everything related afterwards, so nobody dared to portray his universe on big screen until [**Dune** from 1984](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087182/?ref_=nm_ov_bio_lk), directed by [**David Lynch**](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000186/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm).

**Dune from 1984** was a relatively tight-budget movie but nevertheless, a very artistic, spectacular and cinematic transposition of Frank's novels, very well narrated and worth to see as a whole. I continue to watch **David Lynch**'s Dune from time to time and this movie is still able to catch my interest, even after so long time. 
Recenty, we saw more movies/tv series related to Dune, where I appreciated *background scenery* and *costume design*, but this aspects alone don't make a movie, so unfortunately, I won't cite them as successors here. 

<br>

### Goal
My goal with this theme was to improve Obsidian by **removing some distractions / annoyances, adding missing features and improving, expanding on available features**. Last but not least, I needed a change of colors, **less extreme black - white values** and **everything printer friendly**, no matter what theme (light / dark) I decided to use. 

Both core functions - printing and presentation **Export as PDF / Slide** got some cleanup and were adapted to work on smaller interfaces too (phone). Also, I tried my best to make Dune accessible to tablets users - since I don't own a tablet myself, any support for these devices relies on **your feedback**. 

_I am very pleased with the features added_ to **Dune** and hope this overhaul will **benefit your workflow** _to compose nice and useful page layouts_, **reduce friction** _with the features installed_ and **improve your overall note-making** in Obsidian _with the regular use of Dune_.

<br>

### Motivation
Also, would you be so nice to treat me with a breakfast or lunch? :) 

**It's not just about the good deed, but to connect with other people**, _like you connect useful and interesting data in Obsidian!_
Please show me your gratitude for the work I have done and smash that [**Buy me a coffee**](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/README.md#contribute)-button at bottom page, this would mean a lot to me! 

Of course I've build Dune for myself at first, however later I added many nice features for a larger audience. At times it wasn't an easy task to code but a true endurance test ! **Thanks for your attention !**

**I released this theme in the hope to make new friends**. _Private massage me_  `Jopp` on [Forum.obsidian.md](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/theme-dune/60433) and let's talk about Obsidian and our knowledge fields. If you need support or you wanna share ideas and interests related to pkm, creative activities, programming or architecture, feel free to contact me. Only serious messages will be accepted, for bug reports please open a ticket on top page, under `Issues`. 

**I'm interested in following topics, in no particular order**:

```
- #architecture,

### Updates

To make sure you're always up-to-date, open Obsidians `Preferences>Appearance>` then click on `Check for updates` 
> → If you can't run the newest version of Obsidian, then try to install older [releases](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/releases) 
of Dune.

## First steps

1. **to display "Dune-1984" correctly** and to get all options added by my theme, get [**Style Settings**](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) by mgMeyers
2. Dune offers a **clean, clutter-free experience**, so most buttons are semi-hidden by default (desktop). Open `Preferences>Style Settings>Dune>Show ui elements` if you want re-enable buttons / tabs and restore default looks of Obsidians. Also take a look at Dune's quick [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/Wiki/Troubleshooting.md#troubleshooting) 
3. download [this companion snippet](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/snippets/folder-icons-v2.css) to **add icons to your folder tree**
5. get a complete overview of Dune's [cssclass cheatsheet](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/Wiki/cheatsheet%20cssclasses%20Dune.md) and Dune's [callout-fences-tags cheatsheet](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/Wiki/cheatsheet-Callouts%2C%20Fences%2C%20Tags.md)

Plugin authors, theme designers and developers put not just skills and a lot of their time at your service because we want to add value to this interconnected world. We also put a lot of love to design and in a second step, to implement our and your ideas and feedbacks as working code parameters. The bigger code projects grow, the harder this code maintenace becomes, because of the sheer amount of commands which need to work together as a whole. 

With every new update quality standards raise, this status quickly becomes a "new normality" and only autors know how much happened behind the scenes to deliver high quality standards. Likewise in a household, no matter how often you cook or clean, after you're done, all your effort is tagged as a matter of fact, a responsibility of somebody else, for which "the others" don't need to care. Let's make this world a better place and start to support consciously benefactors to become in turn, benefactors ourselves.
