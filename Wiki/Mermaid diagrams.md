## Mermaid diagrams

if you want to change Mermaids colors, you need to download this companion snippet: [Dune-mermaid.css](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/snippets/Dune-mermaid.css). 
Dune should cover most, if not all mermaid diagram types for both dark / light theme - if you notice missing diagrams or hard to read strings, then please let me know and send me a report, just click the tab **Issues** on top, thanks.

### Mermaid Diagrams on-the-fly

Use [Quickadd](https://github.com/chhoumann/quickadd) by **chhoumann** or any text-expander application to add custom-made mermaid templates on-the-fly. Another good option is [Mermaid tools](https://github.com/dartungar/obsidian-mermaid) by dartungar.
