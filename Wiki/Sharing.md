## Slide(show)

- **Slide smaller text** - to display more content on-screen (see `Style Settings>Dune>Fonts>Spacing>Slide smaller text`)
- to configure text alignment of your slides, see `Style Settings>Dune>Fonts>Spacing>Typesetting alignment (global)`
- cleaner slideshow slides for Obsidians core plugin **Slide**
- most features added by Dune work in Slide (sidebox, picture callouts, etc).  


### Tips for phone/mobile
to move between slides, 
- swipe from right to left to move forward
- swipe from left to right to move backwards
- use the upper or lower margin of your slide to swipe
- go to `Preferences>Style Settings>Dune>❨ ❩ Show ui elements>Extra toggles>Show touch-area`and activate a dashed line to see your available touch area, wich lies between the screen top and the dashed line
- use two fingers and swipe back or forth on-screen, if you want to swipe in the middle of your slide.

### Tips for desktop
to move between slides, 
- press the arrow keys on your keyboard to move back or forth
- click once on the slide window if you cannot move back or forth, then navigate back or forth with the arrow keys
- you cannot move forward on the last slide and you cannot move backwards on the first slide 
- to close your slide, hover over the top right corner
- open Slide from Preview view to get better results

## Pdf export
- replaced dark themed backgrounds with white, printer-friendly backgrounds
- all text is optimized for readablility
- Horizontal lines are special in Dune, in fact, each time you add a hr `---` to your note, you tell Dune to add a **Page Break**. Please do not forget to surround each hr with an empty line above and below. If you want to keep Obsidians default hr so that pages (pdf export) do not break with a hr in place, then go to Obsidians `Settings>Dune>Fonts>Spacing>Line>Page counter` and choose the first option in the dropdown button.
