# UI improvements

- **Banners, picture placements and picture arrangements** eg. add footer or top -banners,  place pictures on page and more: [see here](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/Wiki/Pictures.md)
- add **multiple linebreaks** , [see here](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/Wiki/Callouts.md#multiple-line-breaks)
- innovative **tag modifiers** to change font font color, font highlight, add subscript and superscript strings and much, much more. [See here](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/Wiki/Text-highlight.md)
- innovative actionable **list bullets** - forget your old-fashion list bullets, because you wont need them anymore. Checkmark buttons replace them completely, they look similar, now `- [ ] some text`
- new **checkboxes without strikeout** - Dune disables strikeout for completed tasks, if you prefer default looks, go to `Preferences>Style Settings>Dune>Show ui elements>Text body>Show strikeout line (checklists)`
- **svg mermaid diagrams** -readable diagram elements (arrows, labels, etc) in both dark and light themes. Learn more about mermaid diagrams in [this tutorial](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/flowchart.html), to see some examples [see here](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/Wiki/Mermaid%20diagrams.md). To enable this feature, you need to install the [Dune-Mermaid.css](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/snippets/Dune-mermaid.css) snippet
- add a variety of **table configurations** to change colors, table highlights (Highlight first, last, alternate column or the last row), special tables (recipes, movie list, contact list) [see here](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/Wiki/Tables.md) 
- add a variety of **beautiful decorations** (horizontal lines) to break chapters, paragraphs. For examples, [see here](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/Wiki/Poetry.md)
- try between 6 varied **theme color schemes** (3 for day and 3 for night) or make it your own, simply go to: **Settings>Style Settings>Dune>Colors>Custom Theme**
- and much more… for a full list of features, see [here](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/Wiki/cheatsheet%20cssclasses%20Dune.md) and [here](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/Wiki/cheatsheet-Callouts%2C%20Fences%2C%20Tags.md)
