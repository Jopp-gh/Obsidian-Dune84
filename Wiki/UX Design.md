## GARBLE INTERFACE
If you get lost with a garbled interface, follow this steps: 

> 1. Always use keyboard shortcuts to open Obsidians Preferences, otherwise select **Preferences** from the top menu bar of Obsidian
> 2. remember, community plugins are loaded last in Obsidians Preferences window eg. sections from top to bottom: **Options, Core plugins, Community plugins**. You can see **Community plugins** in the left panel of **Settings** as the last menu section.
> 3. remember **Community plugins** are sorted in alphabetical order in there, so **Style Settings** with **S** will be relatively low in the load order, esp. if you have lots of plugins installed
> 4. In **Style Settings**, you can reveal your loaded **Community plugins** names if you click on them. After you found Dune's Preferences, go to Dune's last section and click the last toggle to deactivate **Garble Interface** and restore Obsidians default user interface.
