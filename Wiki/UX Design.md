# UI improvements
## phone / tablet
- new **find-and-replace** dialog
- bigger buttons, overall more space on screen
- to **open Obsidians preferences**, swipe from left to right, to open the Right sidepanel, swipe from right to left.
- to **rename** a note, use the command palette or touch the top-left area on your display

## desktop
- **rename** your notes with right-click on your active tab and confirm to rename or hover-over your note header, then click to edit or right-click on your file/folder in the *folder-tree view*
- #desktop: to display your **status bar**, hover over the bottom-right corner (re-enable in **Style Settings>Dune>Show ui elements>show status bar**, if desired)
- clean interface - most buttons are hidden / semi-hidden by default

  
## both devices
- new **find-and-replace** dialog
- personalize your vault with a true [**Profile picture**](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/Wiki/Profile.md) (see **Style Settings>Dune>Pictures**)
- to **garble** your note add `cssclass: hide-doc` to your yaml header and to garble your App interface, see `Preferences>Style Settings>Dune>Show ui elements>`

### Garble Interface
If you get lost after garbling your interface, follow this guide: 

> 1. Always use a keyboard shortcut key for Obsidians Preferences
> 2. remember that community plugins are loaded in Obsidians Preferences window on the left hand panel as the last menu section, eg. sections from top to bottom: **Options, Core plugins, Community plugins**
> 3. remember **Community plugins** are sorted in alphabetical order in there, so **Style Settings** will be relatively low in the load order, esp. if you have lots of plugins installed
> 4. so, after you clicked on **Style Settings**, Dune will open, then go to the last section and click the last toggle to deactivate the garbled UI
