# UI improvements

- **Banners, picture placements and picture arrangements** eg. add footer or top -banners, add moodboards masonry, place pictures on page and more: [see here](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/Wiki/Pictures.md)
- auto-zoom on images, diagrams (mermaid, svg), math formulas `Preferences>Style Settings>Dune>Pictures>Zoom Pictures>Zoom pictures / diagrams`
- new **typesetting alignment** allows you to shape and move your text blocks to the **Right**, the middle **Axis** or justified **Block** 
- add **linebreak** placeholders, [see here](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/Wiki/Callouts.md#multiple-line-breaks)
- add **pagebreak** placeholders. This feature is enabled by default, just add a new paragraph, 3 hypens and then again a paragraph. To check, go to: `Preferences>Style Settings>Dune>Fonts>Spacing>Line>Page counter - Pdf`
- innovative **tag modifiers** to change font size, font color, font highlight, add subscript and superscript strings and much, much more. [See here](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/Wiki/Text-highlight.md)
- innovative actionable **list bullets** - forget your old-fashion list bullets, because you wont need them anymore. Checkmark buttons replace them completely, they look similar, now `- [ ] some text`
- new **checkboxes without strikeout** - Dune disables strikeout for completed tasks, if you prefer default looks, go to `Preferences>Style Settings>Dune>Show ui elements>Show strikeout line (checklists)`
- A powerful **Timeline callout** to take your checklists and notes to the next level - [see here](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/Wiki/Callouts.md#timeline)
- **svg mermaid diagrams** -readable diagram elements (arrows, labels, etc) in both dark and light themes. In addition you'll be able to scale and zoom diagrams. Learn more about mermaid diagrams in [this tutorial](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/flowchart.html), to see some examples [see here](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/Wiki/Mermaid%20diagrams.md). To enable this feature, you need to install the [Dune-Mermaid.css](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/snippets/Dune-mermaid.css) snippet
- add a variety of **table configurations** to change colors, table highlights (Highlight first, last, alternate column or the last row), special tables (recipes, movie list, contact list) [see here](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/Wiki/Tables.md) 
- add a variety of **beautiful decorations** (horizontal lines) to break chapters, paragraphs. For examples, [see here](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/Wiki/Poetry.md)
- **semantic folder tree** (icons and colors) to visually structure your folders in Obsidian, [see here ](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/Wiki/Folders.md)
- **garble** your notes, to do so, add `cssclass: hide-note` as cssclass and to garble your App interface, see `Preferences>Style Settings>Dune>Show ui elements>Extra toggles`
- personalize your vault with a true [**Profile picture**](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/Wiki/Profile.md) (see **Style Settings>Dune>Pictures**)
- try between 4 varied **theme color schemes** (2 for day and 2 for night) or make it your own, simply go to: **Settings>Style Settings>Dune>Colors>Custom color**
- new **find-and-replace** dialog
- and much more… for a full list of features, see [here](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/Wiki/cheatsheet%20cssclasses%20Dune.md) and [here](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/Wiki/cheatsheet-Callouts%2C%20Fences%2C%20Tags.md)


### Phone / Tablet
- bigger buttons, overall more space on screen
- to **open Obsidians preferences**, swipe from left to right, to open the Right sidepanel, swipe from right to left.
- to **rename** a note, use the command palette or touch the top-left area on your display

### Desktop
- **rename** your notes with right-click on your active tab or hover-over your note header or right-click on your file/folder in the *folder-tree view*
- to display your **status bar**, hover over the bottom-right corner (to re-enable Obsidians status bar, go to **Style Settings>Dune>Show ui elements>show status bar**)
- clean interface - most buttons are hidden / semi-hidden by default

## Font activation / refresh (Style Settings plugin)
if your custom fonts do not load for some reason, refresh your fonts by deleting and re-entering some character in `Preferences>Style Settings>Dune>Fonts>Typesets` or `Preferences>Style Settings>Dune>Fonts>Extra Fonts`

## GARBLE INTERFACE
If you get lost with a garbled interface, follow this steps: 

> 1. Always use keyboard shortcuts to open Obsidians Preferences, otherwise select **Preferences** from the top menu bar of Obsidian
> 2. remember, community plugins are loaded last in Obsidians Preferences window eg. sections from top to bottom: **Options, Core plugins, Community plugins**. You can see **Community plugins** in the left panel of **Settings** as the last menu section.
> 3. remember **Community plugins** are sorted in alphabetical order in there, so **Style Settings** with **S** will be relatively low in the load order, esp. if you have lots of plugins installed
> 4. In **Style Settings**, you can reveal your loaded **Community plugins** names if you click on them. After you found Dune's Preferences, go to Dune's last section and click the last toggle to deactivate **Garble Interface** and restore Obsidians default user interface.
