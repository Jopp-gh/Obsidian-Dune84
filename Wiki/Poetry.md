**Example**
`#dropcap ==A==`  or `#raisecap ==A==` or 

**German**: `#Initiale-t ==A==` oder `#Initiale ==A==` 

<br>

Choose how your **first letter**, your **Initial**, should look like: 
- Dropcaps  (half submerged and surrounded by a text block)
- Raisecaps (on the same baseline with the first line but bigger First Letter)

>**Obsolete**: 
Callouts are obsolete and have been superseded by text tags

## Horizontal Line Styles
![P2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48620536/222981063-8ab2dc90-1729-46fc-a9d6-d82e1e00d878.png)

Options: `cssclass: wave-a`, `cssclass: wave-b`, `cssclass: wave-c`, `cssclass: wave-d`, `cssclass: wave-e`, `cssclass: wave-f`, `cssclass: wave-g`

these are pretty delimiters to divide chapters, paragraphs or to add a little design to your pages. If you want simple delimiters, check out [simple delimiters](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/Wiki/Text-highlight.md#simple-horizontal-lines)

<br>

### Usage
First, pick a horizontal line style (see Options above) eg. `cssclass: wave-a` for your yaml header, 
then add two paragraphs and write 3 dashes `---`

### Resize Line styles

to resize your horizontal line style, go to **Dune>Fonts>Poetry Fonts>Resize decorations**

>**Tip**
>assign a shortcut to **Style Settings: Show style settings view** in Obsidian's **Preferences>Shortcuts**, so you can open Style Settings side-by-side to your note and see in real time how your slider affects the **Line styles decoration** size

### Special features
Horizontal lines are special in Dune, in fact, each time you add a hr `---` you tell Dune to add a **Page Break**. Make sure to surround hr's with an empty line before and after. If you want to keep Obsidians default hr so that pages (pdf export) do not break with a hr in place, then go to Obsidians `Settings>Dune>Fonts>Spacing>Line>Page counter` and choose the first option in the dropdown button.
