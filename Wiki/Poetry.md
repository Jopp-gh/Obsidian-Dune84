```
>[!raisecap]
> Raisecaps etc.
```

```
>[!dropcap]
> D

ropcap etc.
```

> **Hint**: In the pictures above, the very first word after the main Letter was emphasized with bold, but you don't need to. 

<br>

You only need to pay attention to use **Uppercase** for your *very first letter*, be it D for Dropcap or R for Raisecap
Both callouts will render the very first letter in big, gothic letters, but you can choose any font you like, please see how in the list below:

- to change fonts, go to **Style Settings>Dune>Fonts>Typesets>3 - Poetry** 
- to change font colors for poetry, go to  **Style Settings>Dune>Colors>Extra Colors>Initial**

## Horizontal Line styles
![P2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48620536/222981063-8ab2dc90-1729-46fc-a9d6-d82e1e00d878.png)

Options: `cssclass: wave-a`, `cssclass: wave-b`, `cssclass: wave-c`, `cssclass: wave-d`, `cssclass: wave-e`, `cssclass: wave-f`, `cssclass: wave-g`

these are pretty delimiters to divide chapters, paragraphs or to add a little design to your pages. If you want simple delimiters, check out [simple delimiters](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/Wiki/Text-highlight.md#simple-horizontal-lines)

<br>

### Usage
First, pick a horizontal line style (see Options above) eg. `cssclass: wave-a` for your yaml header, 
then add two paragraphs and write 3 dashes `---`

### Resize Line styles

to resize your horizontal line style, go to **Dune>Fonts>Poetry Fonts>Resize decorations**

>**Tip**
>assign a shortcut to **Style Settings: Show style settings view** in Obsidian's **Preferences>Shortcuts**, so you can open Style Settings side-by-side to your note and see in real time how your slider affects the **Line styles decoration** size

### Special features
Horizontal lines are special in Dune, in fact, each time you add a hr `---` you tell Dune to add a **Page Break**
