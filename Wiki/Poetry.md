Pay attention to use **Uppercase** for your *very first letter*.

## Horizontal Line styles

Options: `cssclass: wave-a`, `cssclass: wave-b`, `cssclass: wave-c`, `cssclass: wave-d`, `cssclass: wave-e`, `cssclass: wave-f`, `cssclass: wave-g`

these are pretty delimiters to divide chapters, paragraphs or to add a little design to your pages. If you want simple delimiters, check out [simple delimiters](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/Wiki/Text-highlight.md#simple-horizontal-lines)

<br>

### Usage
First, pick a horizontal line style (see Options above) eg. `cssclass: wave-a` for your yaml header, 
then add two paragraphs and write 3 dashes `---`

### Resize Line styles

to resize your horizontal line style, go to **Dune>Fonts>Poetry Fonts>Resize decorations**

**Tip**
<br>
assign a shortcut to **Style Settings: Show style settings view** in Obsidian's **Preferences>Shortcuts**, so you can open Style Settings side-by-side to your note and see in real time how your slider affects the **Line styles decoration** size
