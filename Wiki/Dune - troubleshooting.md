### Troubleshooting
**Dune hides everything**
Please install the **Style Settings** plugin so you can access all features of Dune. Without this plugin, Dune won't work correctly.

**Problems with Dune's configuration**
With the `Style Settings` extension installed, open the command palette, then type `style settings` and confirm. Drag the resulting window to the right-side dock in Obsidian. From now on, it will be a breeze for you to explore Dune and  tweak the interface to your liking, Nice!

**Missing something in Dune's interface?** 
Open `Settings>Style Settings>Dune>Show ui elements`to unhide Obsidians default interface hidden in Dune by default. Dune hides interface elements is to help you focus on your notes, this helps advanced users. Beginners need to familiarize first with Obsidian, so feel free to restore the default look of Obsidian.

**Slow interface**
Please use the latest version of **Obsidian**, **Style Settings** and **Dune**. Otherwise you will experience strange glitches or slowdowns. 

**Change the Color accent**
if you use the flat light / flat dark theme of Dune, navigating to `Settings>Appearance>Accent color` like you did normally and change the color accent to your liking

**Problems with margins**
is there a big margin on the left side? try to deactivate `Settings>Editor>Readable line lenght` switched on by default.

**Problems with fonts**
open `Settings>Style Settings>Dune>Fonts` and then look for the right options (**Typesets / Extra Fonts / Special Header Fonts**) . In there, delete and re-enter just some Character in the input fields to refresh fonts. Alternatively, click the `Restore default` Button at the end of the input field.

**Problems with colors**
if Dune is unable to display a color, find the missing color under `Settings>Style Settings>Dune>Colors`, click it and press the `Save`. Alternatively, click the `Restore default` Button.

**Stuck in Dune's garbled interface?**
Open Obsidians Settings and you will see a colum on the left with a larger area on the right. Now click in the left column on some line at the bottom left. You will see that Dune reveals the name of Extensions if you click on them. Check the first letter of "some extension" to understand where in the alphabet you are. **Style Settings** begins with **S** and must be somewhere at to the bottom of your extension list. Just click through the Extensions till you find **Style Settings**. In there, expand the last section of Dune and you will see **Hide App UI** revealed. Deactivate that toggle.
