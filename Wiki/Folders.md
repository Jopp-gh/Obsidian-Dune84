# Folders

### Folder colors
apply folder colors: rename folders with up to **10 colors** (0 - 9), add a number in front of your folder names,  eg. `1 Name`.
Just make sure to add a valid number (single digit) in front of your folder name (must be the very first character of your folder name) from 0 - 9 followed by an `empty space` or `hyphen`.

renaming folder `Archive` reveals its color code, in this case "4"


### Folders Icons
add keywords to folder names (the keyword must be last if you add multiple words to a name)

This snippet is an extension of Dune, because this way you get the chance to display the icons you like with the keywords you need. 
To add this snippet, download [folder-icons.css](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/snippets/folder-icons-v2.css) this snippet, before you change anything in Obsidian. 
To get started, pick a random keyword listed below (keywords which share the same icon are separated with a slash "/"): 

- Workbench
- Journal / Training / Education
- Design / Draft
- Read
- Project
- Responsibility / Area
- Resources
- Archive
- Portfolio
- Photo
- Software / Linux / Mac / Win
- Entertainment / Movie
- Study / Research
- Contact
- Society / Social
- Health
- Network
- Travel
- Sport
- Language
- Code / Shell
- Game

### Usage:

 to add colors and icons to your folders, use this name convention : 
- `colorID keyword`= "1 Project"
- `colorID JohnnyDecimalNumber folderName keyword`= "1 30 Test Project" 

### Important

Keywords are case sensitive, this means, if you add eg. "project" instead of eg "Project", then keywords won't apply icons.
Check the folder-icons.css snippet and make changes as you see fit. You can add or remove keywords, change keywords to lowercase and change or remove icons. Find a list of available icons on top page of the above mentioned snippet.
