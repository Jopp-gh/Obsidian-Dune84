**add folder colors**: rename folders with a `color-id` from 0 to 9 (**10 colors**)
<br>

### Example
- add a single-digit number in front of your folder name, eg. add "4"in front of `Archive` (as in the picture below) separated with a `space`
- Whenever you rename a folder with a `color-id` assigned, the folder name will expand and reveal also its `color code`, in our example it is "4" which is the color for "lime" (see picture below)

### Usage
add a number in front of your folder name from 0-9,  eg. `1 Name`.

**Tip**
- Just make sure to add a valid number 
- the first character must be single digit and the very first position of your folder name
- add an `empty space` or `hyphen`to divide your `color id` from the "real name" of your folder, eg. `Color-id Foldername`

## Folders Icons

to **add icons** to your folders, *add keywords* to folder names, eg. `Project`, `Area`, `Resources`, `Archive`

### Usage
1. To get started, download [folder-icons.css](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/snippets/folder-icons-v2.css) first.
2. Then [install **folder-icons.css**](https://help.obsidian.md/Extending+Obsidian/CSS+snippets), 
3. pick a random keyword listed below (notice, keywords which share the same icon are separated with a slash "/"): 

- Workbench
- Journal / Training / Education
- Design / Draft
- Read
- Project
- Responsibility / Area
- Resources
- Archive
- Portfolio
- Photo
- Software / Linux / Mac / Win
- Entertainment / Movie
- Study / Research
- Contact
- Society / Social
- Health
- Network
- Travel
- Sport
- Language
- Code / Shell
- Game

### In practice
to add *colors* and *icons* to your folders, use this name convention : 
<br>
a) `colorID keyword`  eg. "1 Project"
<br>
b) `colorID JohnnyDecimalNumber folderName keyword`  eg. "1 30 Test Project" 

**Tip**
<br>
your *folder keyword* **must be last**, if you add multiple words to a folder name
**Folders Icons** is an extension of Dune, because this way you can display the icons you like with the keywords you need. 
Keywords are case sensitive, this means, if you add eg. "project" instead of eg "Project", then keywords won't apply icons.

<br>

### Expanding available Iconset
Check the folder-icons.css snippet and make changes as you see fit. 
You can add or remove keywords, change keywords to lowercase and change or remove icons. Find a list of available icons in [folder-icons.css](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/snippets/folder-icons-v2.css) or add new icons by yourself, check out icon libs like: https://lucide.dev


## Interacting with folders

if your Vault name is disabled, [drag n drop](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/Wiki/Profile.md#drag-n-drop-area) folders and files over your Profile / blue drop area (the blue drop area will appear if you drag files or folders over the empty space on top over your folder tree)
