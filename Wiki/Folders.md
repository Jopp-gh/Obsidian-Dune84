## Folder colors

Basically, add a number, (we call it `color-id`) in front of your folder name from 0-9 (**10 colors available**),  eg. `1 Name`. 

<br>

### Example
- add a *single-digit number* in front of your folder name, eg. add "4"in front of `Archive` (as in the picture below) separated with a `space`
- Whenever you rename a folder with a `color-id` assigned, that folder name will expand and reveal also its `color-id`, in our example it is "4" which is the color for "lime" (see picture below)

**Tip**
- Just make sure to add a valid number 
- the first character must be single digit
- add an `empty space` or `hyphen`to divide your `color-id` from the "real name" of your folder, eg. `Color-id Foldername`

## Folders Icons

to **add icons** to your folders, *add keywords* to folder names, eg. `Project`, `Area`, `Resources`, `Archive`

### Usage
1. To get started, download [folder-icons-v2.css](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/snippets/folder-icons-v2.css) first.
2. Then [install **folder-icons-v2.css**](https://help.obsidian.md/Extending+Obsidian/CSS+snippets), 
3. pick a random or selected keyword from the list below (notice, keywords which share the same icon are separated with a slash "/") and add it to your folder name: 

- Workbench
- Journal / Training / Education
- Design / Draft
- Read
- Project
- Responsibility / Area
- Resources
- Archive
- Portfolio
- Photo
- Software / Linux / Mac / Win
- Entertainment / Movie
- Study / Research
- Contact
- Society / Social
- Health
- Network
- Travel
- Sport
- Language
- Code / Shell
- Game

<br>

### In practice
to add *colors* AND *icons* to your folders, use following *name convention* : 
<br>
a) `colorID keyword`  eg. "1 Project"
<br>
b) `colorID JohnnyDecimalNumber folderName keyword`  eg. "1 30 Test Project" 

**Tip**
<br>
- if you add multiple words to a folder name, your *keyword* **must be last**
- **Folders Icons** is an extension of Dune, because this way you can display the icons you like with the keywords you need. 
- Keywords are case sensitive, this means, if you add eg. "project" instead of "Project", then keywords won't work.

### Expanding available Iconset
Check the [folder-icons-v2.css](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/snippets/folder-icons-v2.css) snippet and make changes as you see fit. 
You can add or remove keywords, change keywords to lowercase and change or remove icons. Find a list of available icons in [folder-icons-v2.css](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/snippets/folder-icons-v2.css) or add new icons by yourself, check out icon websites like: https://lucide.dev

## Interacting with folders

if your Vault name is disabled, [drag n drop](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/Wiki/Profile.md#drag-n-drop-area) folders and files over your Profile / blue drop area (the blue drop area will appear if you drag files or folders over the empty space on top over your folder tree)
