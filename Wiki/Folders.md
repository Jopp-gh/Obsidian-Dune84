# Folders

## Folder colors

to add or change folder colors, choose a number from 0-9 (see figure 1 above) 
Just rename your folder with a `color-id` and add a `space` followed by a `name of your choice.`

<br>

### Example
- add a *single-digit number* in front of your folder name, eg. add "4"in front of `Archive` (please see picture below) separated by a `space`
- After you renamed a folder with a `color-id`, this id will be hidden until you rename it again

now lets combine both `colorID` and `keywords`:

`1 Project`, `2 Area`, `3 Resources`, `4 Archive`

**Tip**
- Just make sure to add a valid number 
- the first character must be single digit
- add an `empty space` or `hyphen`to divide your `color-id` from the "real name" of your folder, eg. `Color-id Foldername`

## Folders Icons

to use **folder icons**, *add special keywords* to folder names, eg. `Project`, `Area`, `Resources`, `Archive`

### Usage
1. To get started, download [folder-icons-v2.css](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/snippets/folder-icons-v2.css) first.
2. Then [install it](https://help.obsidian.md/Extending+Obsidian/CSS+snippets), 
3. pick a random keyword from the list below (notice, keywords which share the same icon are separated with a slash "/"): 

- Workbench
- Journal / Training / Education
- Design / Draft
- Read
- Project
- Responsibility / Area
- Resources
- Archive
- Portfolio
- Photo
- Software / Linux / Mac / Win
- Entertainment / Movie
- Study / Research
- Contact
- Society / Social
- Health
- Network
- Travel
- Sport
- Language
- Code / Shell
- Game

### In practice
to add *colors* AND *icons* to your folders, use following *name convention* : 
<br>
a) `colorID keyword`  eg. "1 Project"
<br>
b) `colorID JohnnyDecimalNumber folderName keyword`  eg. "1 30 Test Project" 


>**Tip**
>- if you add multiple words to a folder name, your *keyword* **must be last**
>- **Folders Icons** is an extension of Dune, because this way you can display the icons you like with the keywords you need. 
>- Keywords are case sensitive, this means, if you add eg. "project" instead of "Project", then keywords won't work.

### Expand the Iconset
Check the [folder-icons-v2.css](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/snippets/folder-icons-v2.css) snippet and make changes as you see fit. 
You can add or remove keywords, change keywords to lowercase and change or remove icons. Find a list of available icons in [folder-icons-v2.css](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/snippets/folder-icons-v2.css) or add new icons by yourself, check out icon websites like: https://lucide.dev

## Interacting with folders

if you enabled a banner or squared profile picture, [drag n drop](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/Wiki/Profile.md#drag-n-drop-area) folders and files over your Profile and a blue drop area will appear
