# Profile
### Phone
you can change your vault name to an icon.

<br>

#### Generic profile Icon
to add a icon, go to **Style Settings>Dune>Pictures>Profile picture  - (phone)**

<br>

#### Custom profile picture

1. find a *black & white icon* / *color icon*, **png file**
2. Make sure your url is correct and if you are allowed to link icons back to Obsidian. To check, type in `![my Pict](https://url/to/your/pic.png)` in a note and give Obsidian a few moments to load some icon from the web (pay attention to the "!" In front of your link)
3. If your link works, go ahead and add your link to the url field in **Style Settings>Dune>Pictures>Profile picture  - (phone)** : `url('https://url/to/your/pic.png')`
4. If you got a *black and white icon*, enable "monochrome vault profile" so you can see your icon also in dark theme mode.


>Obsolete: Profile Pictures on desktop don't work anymore starting with Obsidian 1.6.0+. Maybe, I will re-implement Profile pictures for desktop in the future.
