### how to add a profile picture

1. find a *black & white icon* / *color icon*, **png file**
2. Make sure your url is correct and if you are allowed to link icons back to Obsidian. To check, type in `![my Pict](https://url/to/your/pic.png)` in a note and give Obsidian a few moments to load some icon from the web (pay attention to the "!" In front of your link)
3. If your link works, go ahead and add your link to the url field in **Style Settings>Dune>Pictures>Profile picture>Profile image** : `url('https://url/to/your/pic.png')`
4. If you got a *black and white icon*, enable "monochrome vault profile" so you can see your icon in with the dark themes too.

### Drag n Drop area

If you activated a profile picture (eg. simple / banner type), drag your file(s) on top of your *profile picture* and a blue drag n drop area will appear, where you can release your files/folders.
