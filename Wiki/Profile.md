### how to add a profile picture

1. find a black & white icon / color icon (png)
2. Make sure your url is correct and if you are allowed to link your icon back to Obsidian . To check , type `![my Pict](https://url/to/your/pic.png)` in a note and give Obsidian a few moments to load your icon ( pay attention to the "!" In front of your link)
3. If your link works, go ahead and add your link to the url field in Style Settings `url('https://url/to/your/pic.png')`
4. If you decide for a black and white icon, enable "monochrome vault profile" so you can see your icon even if you switch to dark themes

### Pick your profile style

Choose between a simple profile icon (eg a squared or round one) or a banner type profile image.
