### Pick your profile style

Choose between a simple profile icon (eg a squared or round one) or a banner type profile image.

### how to add a profile picture

1. find a black & white icon / color icon (png)
2. Make sure your url is correct and if you are allowed to link your icon back to Obsidian . To check , type `![my Pict](https://url/to/your/pic.png)` in a note and give Obsidian a few moments to load your icon ( pay attention to the "!" In front of your link)
3. If your link works, go ahead and add your link to the url field in Style Settings `url('https://url/to/your/pic.png')`
4. If you decide for a black and white icon, enable "monochrome vault profile" so you can see your icon even if you switch to dark themes

### Drag n Drop area

If you have a profile picture (eg. simple / banner type) activated , then drag your file(s) on top of your profile picture to move your file(s) to the root directory of Obsidian
If you don't have any profile picture enabled and your vault name is disabled, then drag your file(s) or folder(s) over the top of your last folder. A blue area will appear where you can release your file(s)
