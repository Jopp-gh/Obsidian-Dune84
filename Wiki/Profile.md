# Profile
## Pick your profile style

Choose between:

- **Simple Profile** icon (eg a squared or round one) 
- **Banner** type profile image.

### how to add a profile picture

1. find a *black & white icon* / *color icon* as **png file**
2. Make sure your url is correct and if you are allowed to link icons back to Obsidian. To check, type in `![my Pict](https://url/to/your/pic.png)` in a note and give Obsidian a few moments to load some icon from the web (pay attention to the "!" In front of your link)
3. If your link works, go ahead and add your link to the url field in **Style Settings>Dune>Pictures>Profile picture>Vault profile image** : `url('https://url/to/your/pic.png')`
4. If you decide for a *black and white icon*, enable "monochrome vault profile" so you can see your icon also with dark themes

### Drag n Drop area

If you activated a profile picture (eg. simple / banner type), then drag your file(s) on top of your *profile picture* if you want to move your file(s) to the root directory of Obsidian.

If you did not activate any profile picture and your vault name is disabled, then drag your file(s) / folder(s) on the empty area over your *folder tree*. A blue area will appear where you can release your file(s)
