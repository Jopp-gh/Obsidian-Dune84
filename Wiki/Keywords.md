# Customize Folders

This snippet is an extension of Dune, because this way you get the chance to display the icons you like with the keywords you need. 
To add this snippet, download [folder-icons.css](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/blob/main/snippets/folder-icons.css), then [install](https://help.obsidian.md/Extending+Obsidian/CSS+snippets) this snippet, before you change anything in Obsidian. 
To get started, pick a random keyword listed below (keywords which share the same icon are separated with a slash "/"): 

- Workbench

### Usage:

 to add colors and icons to your folders, use this name convention : 
- `colorID keyword`= "1 Project"
- `colorID JohnnyDecimalNumber folderName keyword`= "1 30 Test project" 

### Important

Just make sure to add a valid number (single digit) in front of your folder name (must be the very first character of your folder name) from 0 - 9 followed by an `empty space` or `hyphen`
