my goal was to build a compact Movie list / overview to remember watched movies, or to bookmark movies to watch. I love good entertainment but keep informations pretty basic. To start, add some basic descriptions (of course you can add much more informations if you wish):

### Table layout

- cover image (recommended)
- title and year (Dune (1984) OR title and a footnote (to display plot, actors, etc)  (recommended)
- duration 
- genre
- director
- rating  (recommended)

### Usage
1) for informations about your movies, visit the Internet Movie Database: https://www.imdb.com/ 
2) next, add a **cssclass**, eg `cssclasses: movies` to your frontmatter
3) optionally, set a special font for your movie title, go to: `Dune>Fonts>Extra Fonts>Special Header Font>Header - Movies`
4) finally, use this template:

```
| cover             | cover             | cover             | cover             | 
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | 
| title (year) [^1] | title (year) [^2] | title (year) [^3] | title (year) [^4] | 
| 100 min           | 100 min           | 100 min           | 100 min           | 
| #action           | #comedy           | #adventure        | #drama            |
| director          | director          | director          | director          |
| ⭐️5/10            | ⭐️5/10            | ⭐️5/10            | ⭐️5/10            | 

```

<br>

1. **cover**: add a cover picture, eg `![[your-picture.jpg]]` 
2. **title**: add a movie name, ideally followed by the release year and a footnote for plots eg. `MovieName (Year) [^1]` 
3. **duration, genre, director and rating** are optional values. 
4. **expand** your movie table with more keywords (rows) or add another movie table below (keep at least an empty line between tables).

>[!tip]
>add as many columns as you like, for a clean overview i suggest 4 in a row for phone and 6 to 8 movies in a row for desktop pcs.
