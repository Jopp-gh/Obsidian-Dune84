## Troubleshooting

### Check your installation
1. Download/update and activate the **Style settings** plugin. *Please don't miss this step*
2. Download/update Dune-Silver or Dune Gold
3. Download/update Dune's companion snippets (Dune's mermaid theme, Dune's folder icons, Dune's supported plugins) *-optional-*


### Dune configuration
Have `Style Settings` installed and activated, then open the command palette with `Ctrl+P` (Win, Linux) or `Cmd+P` (Mac) and type `style settings` to get `style settings: show style settings view` and confirm. Now, Style settings will open as a note. Grab and drag its tab to the right or left side dock of Obsidian. From now on, you can tweak Dune's interface to your hearts content, Nice!

### Unable to access Obsidian Settings (phone)
to open Settings, open the command palette with a swipe from the top border down. With the command palette open, type `settings` and confirm the suggestion `Open settings`

### Unable to exit from Canvas (phone)
tab on the Tabs button or the hamburger menu at the bottom. Alternatively, tab on the history back arrow button at the bottom or open the command palette with a swipe from the top border down, then choose your homepage note / dashboard note and exit form Canvas mode.

### Slow interface
Please check if you have the latest version of Dune.
To make sure you're always up-to-date, open Obsidians `Settings>Appearance>` then click on `Check for updates`

### Interface looks odd
A possible cause is an outdated version of Dune.
Yet another cause are incompatible snippets, trying to change the same rules as Dune modifies. Finally, please check if you need to update Dune's companion snippets, if you use these snippets too.
Obsidian is changing all times and Dune needs to adapt to this develpment process. Sometimes the changes in Obsidian are minor, sometimes major and due to these circumstances, some features of Dune may not work as expected or break completely. 

### Dune hides everything
Open `Dune>Show` to reveal hidden elements in Dune.
Hidden interface elements should help you to focus better on your work. If you are a newcomer, try first to familiarize with Obsidians interface, before you hide or deactivate something.

### Large margins
if you experience large margins, try to deactivate `Settings>Editor>Readable line lenght` as this option is usually on in Obsidian by default.

### Large fonts
Reset font size to defaults in `Dune>Fonts>Typesets` and `1 - Modern` or `2 - Poetry` or `3 - Dashboard` with the slider `Custom Font size`

### Footnotes disappeared
If you use `banner-b` which is a foot banner, remove that banner. 

### Problems with fonts
open `Dune>Fonts` . In there, delete and re-enter some Character in the input fields to refresh fonts. Alternatively, click the `Restore default` Button at the end of the input field.

### Typesetting cssclass
Typesetting **cssclass** `ftheme-1`, `ftheme-2` and `ftheme-3` applies only to the current note in Preview View

### Callout framed-a
If typesetting alignment is set to justified, then the callout `framed-a` won't align at the center.

### Problems with colors
if Dune is unable to display some color, go to`Dune>Colors`, click on the color you miss and in the popup, press `Save`. Alternatively, click the `Restore default` Button. This should refresh Dune's color palette as well.

### About the accent color
you can switch to Dunes default accent color if you activate `Dune>Show>Main window>Dune accent`.

### Feature X doesn't work anymore
please check Dune's wiki to see if the feature in question changed the way to work (new metadata keywords or names). Dune's wiki reflects always the leatest state of Dunes features and covers everything in detail. Some feature may be missing because broken in newer versions of Obsidian. Also, please check the cheatsheets to get a quick overview.

### Other Issues
Check your CSS snippets under `Settings>Appearance>CSS snippets` and deactivate them all to see if this solves your issue.
If you're using my companion snippets, try to download them again, to make sure you have the latest version of these snippets.

### Exit from zoomed view (phone)
To exit from zoomed images, tab outside. To exit from mermaid diagrams, tab on the tab button or the hamburger menu at the bottom.

### Note title is visible all times (phone)
Just tab the title field one more time and then tab outside. This should hide your title again.

### Top margin in edit mode (phone)
the top bar is a small and thight space, with title, path bar, the (superfluous) left sidebar button and if you install plugins, (example, **Commander plugin** to name one of them) additional buttons. These buttons and bars will operlap with your notes, making editing much harder at the top. Additionally, in edit mode OBSIDIAN jumps abruptly to the top, when the keyboard shifts in.
With Dune, the switch between preview mode and edit mode / live preview is less abrupt and smoother so you can edit your first line always without surprise and without buttons or names in your way.

### Dune Silver - Dune Gold
Dune-Silver is free and packed with a lot of features on top of stylistical changes. To make my project not just future-proof but more important, sustainable, I've split the future development of Dune into two branches, a free and a paid -tier. Dune Gold is packed with many more features.
To support the development and maintainace of my project AND to get more control over fonts, images and view options in Obsidian, consider to visit my shop at [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jopp.gh) to get Dune-Gold.

I've spent more than a hundred of hours in research, design, development, implementation and refinement of Dune's features in the past 3 years. Also, my theme covers desktop pc's (Mac/Linux/Win) as well as phone (Android) devices and should work also on iOs iphones. 
Only maintenance guarantees that all features of Dune work as expected.
