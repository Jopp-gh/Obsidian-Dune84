## Troubleshooting

### Check your installation
1. Download/update and activate the **Style settings** plugin. *Please don't miss this step*
2. Download/update Dune, the theme
3. Download/update Dune's companion snippets (Dune's mermaid theme, Dune's folder icons, Dune's supported plugins)  *-optional-*

   
### Dune configuration
Have `Style Settings` installed and activated, then open the command palette with `Ctrl+P` (Win, Linux) or `Cmd+P` (Mac) and type `style settings` to get `style settings: show style settings view` and confirm. Now, Style settings will open as a note. Pick its tab and drag this window to the right- or left side dock of Obsidian. From now on, you can tweak Dune's interface to your hearts content, Nice!

### Slow interface
Please check if you have the latest version of Dune. 
To make sure you're always up-to-date, open Obsidians `Preferences>Appearance>` then click on `Check for updates`
> → _If you can't run the newest version of Obsidian_, then try to install older [releases](https://github.com/Jopp-gh/Obsidian-Dune84/releases)
of Dune. Note, you should prefer to install Dune directly from within Obsidian as the files under **releases** here are older versions and available for the only purpose to add backwards compatibiliy to older versions of Obsidian.

### Interface looks odd
A possible cause is an outdated version of Dune. 
Yet another cause are incompatible snippets that try to change the same rules as Dune. Finally, please check if you need to update Dune's companion snippets, if you use these snippets too. 
Obsidian is changing all times, so Dune needs to adapt to this develpment process as well. Sometimes the changes in Obsidian are minor, sometimes major and due to these circumstances, some features of Dune may not work as expected or break completely. Please consider to support me for this ongoing maintainance.  If you buy Dune-Gold on my [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jopp.gh) shop, you will get an upgraded Dune with much more features than Dune-Silver.

### Dune hides everything
Open `Settings>Style Settings>Dune>Show` to reveal hidden elements in Dune. 
Hidden interface elements should help you to focus more on your work. Newcomers need to familiarize first with Obsidian, so feel free to restore anything missing in Obsidian's interface.

### Large margins
if you experience large margins, try to deactivate `Settings>Editor>Readable line lenght` as this option is usually on in Obsidian by default.

### Footnotes disappeared
If you use `banner-b` which is a page foot banner, remove that banner

### Problems with fonts
open `Settings>Style Settings>Dune>Fonts` . In there, delete and re-enter some Character in the input fields to refresh fonts for Dune. Alternatively, click the `Restore default` Button at the end of the input field.

### Typesetting cssclass
Typesetting **cssclass** `ftheme-1`, `ftheme-2` and `ftheme-3` applies only to the current note in Preview View, not in Live-View or Source -View.

### Problems with colors
if Dune is unable to display some color,  go to`Settings>Style Settings>Dune>Colors`, click on the color you miss and in the popup, press `Save`. Alternatively, click the `Restore default` Button. This should refresh Dune's color palette.

### About the accent color
the accent color of Obsidian works only limited in Dune. I may change this behavior in future versions of Dune, if there is interest.

### Other Issues
Check your CSS snippets under `Settings>Appearance>CSS snippets` and deactivate them all to see if this solves your issue. 
If you're using my companion snippets, try to download them again, to make sure you have the latest version of these snippets. 

### Exit from zoomed view (phone)
To exit from zoomed images, tab on the left of right screen border.

### Note title is visible all times (phone)
Just tab on the title field and then, tab away on your note. This should hide again your name field.

### Top margin in edit mode (phone)
the top bar is a small and thight space, with title, a path, the (superfluous) left sidebar button and some more buttons if you install plugins, (example, **Commander plugin** to name one of them) .
These interface elements will inevitably operlap with your note lines and make editing harder at the top page. Additionally, in edit mode OBSIDIAN jumps abruptly seveal lines to the top, when you enter in edit mode. This happens, because your keyboard pushes some lines up.
With Dune, the switch between preview mode and edit mode / live preview is less abrupt but more smooth and you can edit your first line always without worrying that something (buttons or names) gets in the way.

### Bug Reports
open a bug report and I will do my best to fix your issue. Please explain in easy-to-follow step-by-step examples how you reproduce the bug. You can add screenshots as well.

### Dune Silver - Dune Gold
Dune-Silver is free and with a lot of features on top of stylistical changes. To make my project not just future-proof but much more important, sustainable, I split the future development of Dune into two branches, in a free and a paid -tier. Dune Gold is packed with many more features.
To support not just my project's development and maintainace, but also to get more control over fonts, images and view options in Obsidian, consider to visit my shop on [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jopp.gh) to get Dune-Gold.

I spent hundreds of hours of continuous work in research, design, development and implementation of features in Dune in the past 3 years. Also, my theme covers desktop pc's (Mac/Linux) and phone (Android) devices. 
Only maintenance guarantees that all features of Dune work as expected.
